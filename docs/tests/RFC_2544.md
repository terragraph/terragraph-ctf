# RFC 2544 Tests
[RFC 2544](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2544) is a standard for performing
network/device characterization tests.

* **Objective**: Run RFC 2544 based 4 network characterization tests on Puma and
  will be performed using Xena chassis.
* **Setup:** P2P, Multi-Hop
* **Frame Sizes to be used:** 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, 1518

## All Tests

### `PUMA_RF_RFC1` Throughput test
Description: This test determines the throughput of a DUT.

Procedure:
* Bring up the P2P link.
* Connect the two nodes to the ports on Xena chassis.
* Run throughput test for the specified frame sizes.

Pass/Fail Criteria:
* Xena must be able to deliver the throughput results successfully.

### `PUMA_RF_RFC2` Latency and Jitter test
Description: This test finds the latency and Jitter of a DUT.

Procedure:
* Bring up the P2P link.
* Connect the two nodes to the ports on Xena chassis.
* Run latency and jitter test for the specified frame sizes.

Pass/Fail Criteria:
* Xena must be able to deliver the latency and Jitter results successfully.

### `PUMA_RF_RFC3` Frame loss rate test
Description: This test determines the frame loss rate of a DUT.

Procedure:
* Bring up the P2P link.
* Connect the two nodes to the ports on Xena chassis.
* Run frame loss rate test for the specified frame sizes.

Pass/Fail Criteria:
* Xena must be able to deliver the frame loss rate results successfully.

### `PUMA_RF_RFC4` Back-to-back test
Description: This test characterizes the ability of a DUT to process
back-to-back frames at various rates.

Procedure:
* Bring up the P2P link.
* Connect the two nodes to the ports on Xena chassis.
* Run frame loss rate test for the specified frame sizes.

Pass/Fail Criteria:
* Xena must be able to deliver the back-to-back results successfully.

### `PUMA_RF_POP_SPANOUT`
Description: To test Maximum aggregated throughput at the POP site when all four
sectors of the site have a terra link.

Test Setup: 4 sector POP site connected to 4 primaries

Procedure:
* Ignite topology to bring up all four terra links each of the POP sectors.
* Start 4 flows of bidirectional UDP traffic from primary on POP node to each of
  the four sites for 900s.
* Repeat above step for TCP traffic.
* Measure aggregated throughput at POP node.

Pass/Fail Criteria:
* Should achieve an aggregated throughput of 4*(4G) bidirectional traffic at the
  POP nodes from the 4 traffic flows.

### `PUMA_RF_3-SECTOR`
Description: To test Maximum aggregated throughput at the POP site when 3
sectors of the site have RF terra link.

Test Setup: RF POP site connected to 3 primaries

Procedure:
* Bring up 3 terra links of the POP sectors.
* Start 3 flows of bidirectional UDP traffic from primary on POP node to each of
  the three sites for 900s.
* Repeat above step for TCP traffic.
* Measure aggregated throughput at POP node.

Pass/Fail Criteria:
* Should achieve an aggregated throughput of 3*(1G) bidirectional traffic at the
  POP nodes from the 3 traffic flows.
