# 802.1X Tests
This document is intended to test the 802.1X based security feature for
Terragraph. It is used to test the 802.1X based authentication. The intent of
this test plan is to evaluate:

* Correctness of 802.1X authentication for max number of peers (either: 16 CNs,
  15 CNs and 1 DN, or 14 CNs and 2 DNs).
* For Puma, correctness of 802.1X authentication for max number (4) of baseband
  cards.
* Robustness of initial association and re-association with 802.1X
  authentication enabled.
* Robustness of 802.1X authentication in the presence of link flaps.
* 802.1X authentication when igniting butterfly topology.
* Performance of P2P / P2MP links with different iPerf packet sizes and packet
  rates, for UDP and TCP traffic (the 802.1X authentication should not affect
  throughput on a link, and the throughput should match the throughput with
  WPA-PSK).

## Preparation Notes
* Provision the EAP-TLS certificates on the nodes. This has to be done once per
  the lifetime of the node. Verify that these certificate files (`ca.pem`,
  `client.csr`, `client.key`, `client.pem`) exist at `/data/secure/keys` on each
  node.
* Configure the IP addresses and passphrases for the test CA and RADIUS server.
* To enable 802.1X based authentication, set `wsecEnable` to 2 in the config
  file. Note that firmware uses `/etc/e2e_config/fw_cfg.json`, but the E2E
  controller and other security scripts use `/data/cfg/node_config.json`. For
  now, do make the `wsecEnable` config change in both the config files.
* All tests assume that the certificates are already provisioned on each
  Terragraph radio, DN or CN, and the config files, `node_config.json` have been
  updated with the settings for the RADIUS server IP and the
  `wsecParams.eapolParams.secrets`.

## Ignition Test Cases

### `PUMA_RF_8021x-1-2` 1DN+16 CN Association with E2E Controller
Description: This test assumes that the certificates are already provisioned on
each Terragraph radio, DN or CN, and the config files, node_config.json have
been updated with the settings for the RADIUS server IP and the
`wsecParams.eapolParams.secrets`. We assume that each DN-CN link is capable of
supporting MCS 12.

Procedure:
* Enable security using the approach described in the Preparation Notes section.
* Sequentially associate 16 CNs.
* Ping on link using link local.
* Send 50Mbps bidirectional iPerf UDP traffic simultaneously on all interfaces
  from traffic generators.
* Dissociate each link from DN Initiator.

Validation:
* All Associations succeed.
* Ping success
* No packet loss.
* iPerf throughput of 50Mbps is achieved on each link.
* Disassociation success.

### `PUMA_RF_8021x-1-4` 1DN+14CN+2DN Association
Procedure:
* Same as 8021x-1-2, but configure as DN responder two of the 16 peers.

### `PUMA_RF_8021x-1-6` Reassoc Stress Test
Procedure:
* Randomly select a peer
* Break the link using attenuator between initiator and peer.
* Set attenuation to 0, and allow the link to come back up.
* After linkup, ping the peer.

Validation:
* No crashes.
* All pings succeed.

This test is the same as `8021x-1-2`, with the topology file including a single
DN-DN P2P link for each baseband card. This test is to be repeated with 2, 3,
and 4 baseband cards attached to the Puma digital board.

Validation:
* Verify that link comes up for all the basebands.

DN-DN and a DN-CN link for each baseband card. This test is to be repeated with
2, 3, and 4 baseband cards attached to the Puma digital board.

Validation:
* Verify that link comes up for all the basebands.

## Throughput Test cases
The throughput test cases will be the same as the one's from Over-The-Air
Security Test Plan for WPA-PSK. Do refer to the Throughput Test cases in this
test plan. The only difference will be that `wsecEnable` is set to 2 to enable
802.1X authentication. There should be no degradation of throughput due to
802.1X authentication.

Description: These test cases are purposed to evaluate the performance impact of
enabling OTA security in topological scenarios.
